# ShellScripts

This is a collection of shell scripts I am writing to make my life easier.

I used to be an avid user of [dendron](https://www.dendron.so/), but as my needs changed, I switched from VSCode emulation of Vim to Vim itself.

I needed shellscripts to replace the functionality that I had once been familiar with. This is the results.


## Scripts

1. [newx](./newx) - make a new bash executable script, `chmod +x` it and Vim into the file
1. [bugdate](./bugdate) - print date in format that I when recording bugs
1. [bugrecord](./bugrecord) - print the template that I use for bugs (using bugdate)
1. [ isosec ](./isosec) - print date format in `+%Y%m%d%H%M%S `
1. [ayn](./ayn) - make an entry for [ Ayn ](https://github.com/husaininazeer/Ayn)
