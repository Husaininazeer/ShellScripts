# ShellScripts

This is a collection of shell scripts I am writing to make my life easier.

I used to be an avid user of [dendron](https://www.dendron.so/), but as my needs changed, I switched from VSCode emulation of Vim to Vim itself.

I needed shellscripts to replace the functionality that I had once been familiar with. This is the results.

## Scripts

- [newx](./newx) - make a new bash executable script, `chmod +x` it and Vim into the file
