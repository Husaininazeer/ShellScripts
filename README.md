# ShellScripts

This is a collection of shell scripts I am writing to make my life easier.

I was an avid user of [dendron](https://www.dendron.so/), but as my needs changed, I switched from VSCode emulation of Vim to Vim itself.

I needed shell scripts like [ayn](./ayn) to replace the functionality that I had once been familiar with. 

This is an iterative process which has an end goal of fitting my use case, but feel free to fork.


## Scripts

1. [newx](./newx) - make a new bash executable script, `chmod +x` it and Vim into the file
1. [bugdate](./bugdate) - print date in format that I when recording bugs
1. [bugrecord](./bugrecord) - print the template that I use for bugs (using bugdate)
1. [isosec](./isosec) - print date format in `+%Y%m%d%H%M%S `, and handle delimiters
1. [ayn](./ayn) - make an entry for [Ayn](https://github.com/husaininazeer/Ayn)
1. ~~[mdlink](./mdlink) - take in an input and surround with braces and brackets in markdown~~ deprecated for snippets (ultisnips)
1. ~~[mdtodo](./mdtodo) - prepend `- [ ] ` to the inputs to represent it as a TODO in markdown~~ deprecated for snippets (ultisnips)
1. [standupreport](./standupreport) - print report template for standups
1. [journaltemp](journaltemp) - print a template that I use for journals
1. [ayn_auto_commit](ayn_auto_commit) - script that auto commits for [Ayn](https://github.com/husaininazeer/Ayn)
